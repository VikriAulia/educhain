## Abstract
Instructional-blockchain is a simple blockchain implementation for educational purpose. It supports generating blocks, varifying blocks, mining blocks, consensus about conflicting chains, connecting peers, and various wallet functions.


Pintos is computer software, a simple instructional operating system framework for the x86 instruction set architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. It was created at Stanford University by Ben Pfaff in 2004.
