```instructional-blockchain``` is an automated testing software.
> The main project of
**Sogang Univ. Blockchain Lab.**   
> Based on [one-chain](https://github.com/twodude/onechain)   

## Abstract
```instructional-blockchain``` is a simple blockchain implementation for educational purpose. It supports generating blocks, varifying blocks, mining blocks, consensus about conflicting chains, connecting peers, and various wallet functions. Like
*Pintos*, simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture, instructional-blockchain project is intended to introduce undergraduates to concepts in blockchain core design and implementation.

It was created at Sogang University's Blockchain Lab. by
**[Luke Park (Sanghyeon Park)](https://github.com/twodude)**
in 2018.
